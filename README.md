# 📡 Swan Teleco — Customer Retention Analysis

## Overview  
A data-driven project for **Swan Teleco** focused on understanding and predicting customer churn.  
The analysis identifies which customers are most at risk of leaving, explores why they churn, and recommends targeted retention strategies.

## Contents  
- **Swan_TeamChurners.ipynb** — Jupyter Notebook containing:  
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing  
  - Exploratory data analysis (EDA) of churn patterns  
  - Predictive modeling using Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and SVM  
  - Feature importance and interpretation  
  - Generation of churn probability scores and top-500 at-risk list  
- **customer_churn_risk.csv** — Predicted churn probabilities for all customers.  
- **top_500_customers.csv** — 500 customers identified as highest churn risk.  
- **Swan_TeamChurners.pdf** — Final report summarizing findings and business recommendations.  

## Project Focus  
> “To identify who is churning, why they churn, and how Swan Teleco can improve retention through data-driven insight.”

## Tools & Libraries  
- Python, Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
